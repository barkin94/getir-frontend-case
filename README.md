# Getir Frontend Case

This is a case project for Getir to showcase a catalog page of a generic E-Commerce web application. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template. Also, json-server was used to feed the app.

To run the application on your local environment Run `npm run dev:front` and `npm run dev:back` concurrently.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev:front`

Runs the app in the through Create React App.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run dev:back`

Launches json-server on (http://localhost:3001).

### `npm start`

Builds the frontend app, then launces a deamonized json-server that serves the frontend build. Meant to be used in production.

### `npm run stop`

Kills the daemonized json-server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
